            Statistics show that approximately 50% of Canadians have suffered
            from mental illness by the time they reach 40, but successful mental
            health treatment can help to minimize the impact this has on an
            individual’s life.

            <br />
            Psychiatrists are doctors specializing in mental health. They treat
            mental, emotional, and behavioural disorders through therapy and
            prescribing medication. Since they are covered by most provincial
            health insurance, you need a doctor’s referral to visit one.
            <br />
            <br />
            Other mental health specialists include counsellors, social workers,
            and psychotherapists. If you’re struggling to find time for an
            appointment, aren’t wanting to physically travel, or face a long
            wait in person, then online therapy can be a good place to start.
            You can get affordable, licensed, online therapy through Focus
            Mental Wellness, and it’s covered by most extended benefits.
